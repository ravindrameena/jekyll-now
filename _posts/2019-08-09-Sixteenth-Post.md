title: GSoC Milestone 2 Journey
---

The second phase of Google Summer of Code 2019 was the most productibe for me.
In phase 1 of Google Summer of Code 2019 only babeltrace was able to read the 
events but now Trace Compass can also read the events. So both babeltrace 
and Trace Compass can read the events.

What was done in phase 2:
**1.)** Produced metadata in LTTng format.

**2.)** Got Trace Compass read the events.

**3.)** Modified the client-side program upto the requirement of metadata.


What Trace Compass can do now with RTEMS target:
**1.)** Display the event names.

**2.)** Display CPU usage and Resources.

**3.)** The idle state of thread.

Some of these features were not possible with babeltrace.
