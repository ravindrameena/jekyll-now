title: GSoC Milestone 1 Journey
---

So yeah I have completed all the tasks of my Milestone 1, and it was really an 
awesome coding period of around 4 weeks. It helps you to learn a lot of stuff, the 
best part is you have to submit the work before the deadline which creates a sense 
of responsibility in you.

## Journey of 4 weeks:

My end semester exams of the final year got finished on 12th May, I was thinking 
to start the coding for GSoC just after that, but due to some other plans with my 
friends(as my end semester exams got over, so yeah celebration is must), therefore 
I was able to start the coding around 18th May. This is the first time I have 
contributed to Open Source.

My 1st Milestone tasks were mostly based on the conversion of current RTEMS record
item into CTF format using babeltrace. I write the metadata for the current RTEMS
record items. Initially I was having difficulty in making the metadata compatible
with current RTEMS record items but after trying few examples I got it alright.

I must say one thing which I have learned in my Open Source Development journey is 
that,

Doing changes in the existing code base to implement your project is really a 
difficult task, but you really learn from it, as you have to make the changes 
ensuring that the code does not break anywhere and all the existing part work as 
earlier too. I found it really difficult in starting, but with the guidance of my 
mentor and maintainers at RTEMS, I managed to make the changes, which proved to be 
a success. This made me pretty relaxed that the most difficult stuff of my 
milestone was completed.

Thanks for reading!
